Selpercatinib,"Dose escalation included narrow dose increments of 33% over the range of 20 mg once daily to 240 mg twice a day to allow for precise initial dose-response analysis for safety. The results from the dose-escalation portion showed 0 of 3 patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at 160 mg twice a day and 2 of 6 patients with DLTs at 240 mg. Initial safety signals associated with concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation influenced selection of the twice a day regimen over the initial once-daily regimen. This was based on the potential higher risk of QT interval prolongation with a once-daily regimen compared with a twice a day regimen where maximum plasma concentrations would be lower, but daily exposure could still be matched to once-daily dosing.",COc1ccc(CN2C3CC2CN(c2ccc(-c4cc(OCC(C)(C)O)cn5ncc(C#N)c45)cn2)C3)cn1,5,tensor([1]),PAIR_118,-1.5862400531768799,-1.0759683847427368,0.9750475891471312,0.08395210987613663,0.0020948075375945467,525.6130000000003,0.00398545610096125
